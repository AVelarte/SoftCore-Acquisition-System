FPGA-Based Electrophysiological Acquisition Platform

This repository contains an open-source, modular FPGA-based platform for the acquisition and processing of electrophysiological signals. The system is designed around a hardware-centric architecture with dedicated FPGA peripherals and an embedded soft-core processor for system control and communication.

Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main components:

Hardware Design (HD)
FPGA hardware description files, including custom peripherals, interfaces, and system integration logic.

Firmware (FW)
Embedded firmware running on the soft-core processor, responsible for system configuration, command handling, and high-level control tasks.

Graphical User Interface (GUI)
Desktop GUI files used to configure the platform, send commands, and interact with the system without requiring direct command-line operation.

Documentation

Basic documentation is provided within the repository.
A detailed user guide for the custom peripheral and system operation is currently under preparation and will be added in a future update.

Status

This project is under active development.
Feedback, suggestions, and contributions are welcome."# SoftCore-Acquisition-System"
